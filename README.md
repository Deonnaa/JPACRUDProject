- Property Search: Offers a robust search functionality to find properties by address, city, state, or zip code.

- Add New Property: Users can easily add new properties to the listing database through a user-friendly interface.

- Edit and Delete Properties: Enables users to update or remove property listings, ensuring the database always stays current.
